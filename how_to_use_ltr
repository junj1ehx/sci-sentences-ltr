1: install ptranking and its requirements: https://wildltr.github.io/ptranking/
2: because format of dataset for deim are followed the 'MQ2008_Super' dataset in LETOR, I used the default setting of 'MQ2008_Super' dataset in ptranking library.
3: because all test dataset have different numbers of features, change the .../ptranking/data/data_utils.py in where you installed ptranking in python library to run the model

###
details of 3:
    elif data_id in MSLETOR_SUPER:
        max_rele_level = None <- set this to adopt continuous label before running
        label_type = LABEL_TYPE.MultiLabel
        num_features = 24 <- change this number when you change your test dataset
        has_comment = True
        fold_num = 5
